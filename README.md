# Stack and Queue Simulation
This project is a simple educational tool designed to help users learn the fundamental concepts of Stack and Queue data structures. It provides basic simulations that demonstrate how elements are added and removed using the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle for stacks and the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle for queues. Ideal for beginners, this project emphasizes clarity and foundational understanding of pointer-based implementations in Python.

## Requirements
Make sure you already settle the python env.

## How to run
Just run `python main.py`. In the main.py file, you can toggle the simulation of basic operations for the Stack or Queue data structure.
```sh
python main.py
```
